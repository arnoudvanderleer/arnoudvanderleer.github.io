Personal Profile
===
I am a reliable person and a team player. I am a curious person, who is eager to learn. I am a mathematician through and through; always thinking about puzzles. Specifically, I have been educated as an arithmetic geometer and I have a broad interest that stretches from category theory and proof assistants to number theory.
