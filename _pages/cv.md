Personal Profile
===
I am a reliable person and a hard-working team player. I am a curious person, who is eager to learn. I am a mathematician through and through; always thinking about puzzles. Specifically, I have been educated in category theory, type theory and arithmetic geometry and I have a broad interest that stretches between and around these areas.
